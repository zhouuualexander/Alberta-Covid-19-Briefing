    <h2 class="text-center" style="color:#00887A;">Here's a timeline of COVID-19 in Alberta</h2>
    <div id="timeline">
        <ul>
            <li><b>March 5</b>: Alberta identifies its first presumptive COVID-19 case, a Calgary woman returning from a California cruise.</li>
            <li><b>March 11</b>: The World Health Organization declares COVID-19 a pandemic, while Alberta begins to recommend against out-of-country travel. The following day, Alberta bans gatherings of more than 250 people.</li>
            <li><b>March 15</b>: Calgary is among Alberta cities to declare a state of local emergency, closing most non-essential businesses and services. Alberta cancels all school classes and declares a provincial public health state of emergency the following day.</li>
            <li><b>March 19</b>: Alberta records its first COVID-19 death, an Edmonton man in his 60s. The province’s case count rises to 146, the majority of which originated through out-of-country travel.</li>
            <li><b>March 31</b>: A third resident of the McKenzie Towne Continuing Care Centre dies of COVID-19. An outbreak at the facility would go on to claim the lives of 19 residents.</li>
            <li><b>April 6</b>: Alberta chief medical officer of health Dr. Deena Hinshaw recommends the use of non-medical face masks when physical distancing is difficult. Modelling suggests a mid-May peak for COVID-19 in Alberta, with around 800,000 total cases in the province. Twenty-four Albertans have died of the virus, with almost 1,350 infections.</li>
            <li><b>April 20</b>: The Cargill meat-packing plant in High River temporarily closes down amid a COVID-19 outbreak. The outbreak would become the largest in Alberta, linked to more than 1,500 case and three deaths. Meanwhile, the JBS meat-processing plant in Brooks would record more than 650 cases.</li>
            <li><b>April 23</b>: The Calgary Stampede cancels its 2020 event, the first time the show didn’t go on since it became an annual tradition in 1923, as Hinshaw restricts gatherings of more than 15 people. The 319 new cases reported stands as Alberta’s highest single-day tally. There are 3,720 total cases in the province, with 68 deaths.</li>
            <li><b>May 3</b>: Alberta records fewer than 100 cases of COVID-19 for the first time since mid-April, signalling the end of the province’s first wave of the virus.</li>
            <li><b>May 13</b>: Alberta enters Stage 1 of its COVID-19 relaunch, letting businesses like restaurants and retailers reopen, but Calgary and Brooks are singled out of the relaunch due to ongoing meat-plant outbreaks. Both municipalities are allowed to join in the relaunch May 25.</li>
